### SSO

The project uses "Single Sign-On - UK Government Security" for authentication. The parameters can be grabbed from AWS parameter store if required locally. If you dont need to SSO locally, just put dummy strings into the ENV variables.

Authorisation is handled in the api repo and allows for users and granular control over access.
